an API for that data so they can make a mobile application. With the data and business rules all
handled in one location, you simply need to share those models with the new API application and
any changes in business logic will be ready for both applications.
Or you might be working for a large insurance company. Because of the way their data needs to
be handled, they have a number of separate applications that all use the same data. </div>
